# Set the entry point to 'main' so the library can be executed directly via linker64
# This allows direct invocation: /system/bin/linker64 libtwoyi.so --help
# We use 'main' because it's the exported Rust function that implements CLI mode
# For shared libraries invoked via linker64, 'main' is the appropriate entry point
# (Note: '_start' is used for standalone executables, not shared libraries)
