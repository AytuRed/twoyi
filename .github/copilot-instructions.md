# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Twoyi

## Updating These Instructions

When making significant changes to the project structure, build process, or policies:
1. Update this file to reflect the new guidelines
2. Document any new conventions or patterns introduced
3. Remove outdated information that no longer applies
4. Keep instructions clear, concise, and actionable
5. Test that the instructions are accurate before committing

## AI-Generated Content Policy

When creating new files (not modifying existing files or vendoring third-party code), add the following header at the top of the file:

```
# Copyright Disclaimer: AI-Generated Content
# This file was created by GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant.
# AI-generated content is not subject to copyright protection and is provided
# without any warranty, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability,
# fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
# Use at your own risk.
```

For different file types, adapt the comment style appropriately:
- Use `#` for YAML, Python, Shell scripts
- Use `//` for Java, Kotlin, C, C++
- Use `<!-- -->` for XML, HTML
- Use `/* */` for CSS, multi-line comments in C/C++

## Exceptions

Do NOT add this disclaimer to:
- Files that are modifications of existing code (only add to completely new files)
- Vendored third-party dependencies (these have their own licenses)
- Configuration files generated by tools (package.json, build.gradle if just updating versions, etc.)

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Target SDK
- This project targets SDK 28 intentionally to allow execution in `/data/user/0/`
- Do not update targetSdk beyond 28 without explicit approval
- compileSdk can be updated for build-time API access (currently set to 35)
